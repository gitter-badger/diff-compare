A javascript library for diffing text and generating corrected and annotated text.  This is a fork and derivative of
[ForbesLindesay/jsdifflib](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/jsdifflib), which is in turn a fork of [cemerick/jsdifflib](https://github.com/cemerick/jsdifflib)

The main difference between this lib and [ForbesLindesay/jsdifflib](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/jsdifflib) is `jsdifflib` returns an HTML node for direct embedding (a table no less), and this module just returns the adjusted text in a JS object. I was implementing a separate view system, so I just needed the data alone.

## Installation

    npm install diff-compare

## Overview

diff-compare is a Javascript library that provides:

1. a partial reimplementation of Pythonâ€™s difflib module (specifically, the SequenceMatcher class)
2. rather than a view generator, as the previous modules have made, this provides a corrected list of items, language agnostic

## Example

```js
var diff = require('diff-compare');

var adjustedText = diff.build({
  baseText: baseText,
  newText: newText
})

// {
//   base: [{
//       originalLine: 1,
//       value: 'abc',
//       type: 'delete'
//     }, {
//       originalLine: 2,
//       value: 'def',
//       type: 'equal'
//     }],
//   compare: [{
//       originalLine: null,
//       value: '',
//       type: 'delete'
//     }, {
//       originalLine: 1,
//       value: 'def',
//       type: 'equal'
//     }]
// }

```
